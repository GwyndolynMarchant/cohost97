# cohost97 - A userstyle for cohost.org

A new userstyle, based on my themes [Mastodon97](https://github.com/GwyndolynMarchant/Mastodon97) and [Discord97](https://github.com/GwyndolynMarchant/Discord97), that styles [cohost](https://cohost.org) like the classic Microsoft operating system Windows 9(5?)(8?).

## How to install

You can use a manager like **Stylus**, which is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).

Then click to [install](https://github.com/GwyndolynMarchant/cohost97/raw/main/cohost97.user.css).
